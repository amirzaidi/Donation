        "Hey!"

        "\n\nMy name is Amir and I am a student at Delft, University of Technology, in the Netherlands."
        "I hope you've been enjoying the Android applications I work on!"

        "\n\nProgramming has been my hobby since primary school."
        "I started on websites, then moved to PC programs, and am now doing Android development."

        "\n\nI'm proud of my most popular Android apps: Rootless Pixel Launcher, Shade, DNG Processor and Pixel Bridge."
        "But there are many more apps that I've worked on, and you've probably never heard of them."
        "For example, I recreated the Squeeze for Assistant feature from Pixels without pressure sensors."
        "There's Google Icons, Material FX, Dynamica, and many more small projects on my GitHub."

        "\n\nEverything I do is free and open source so others can improve it and make even better apps."
        "Now I, as everyone else, have only a limited amount of time."
        "You can support me and my journey by buying 'A Feeling of Pride and Accomplishment' with the orange button above."
        "Buying it will unlock a banner in the app that thanks you for the purchase."
        "Every purchase will be remembered, and put to use for updates and new applications in the future."

        "\n\nIf you wish to contact me, it is easy to reach me outside of school hours."
        "Click on the three dots in the top right corner of the screen."
        "There you can select either Telegram or E-mail as the means to reach me."
        "I do not read my e-mails often, so if you have something urgent I highly recommend using Telegram."

        "\n\nThanks for reading my story!"
        "\n\nAmir Zaidi"
